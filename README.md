# WindowsGSM.Rising World
üß©WindowsGSM plugin that provides Rising World Dedicated server

## To note:
- WGSM will load the unity beta branch as handling JAVA executables is ... a pain. 
- You can change that by modifying the RisingWorld.cs 
  - line 27 AppId to just "339010"
  If that is then still the Java Version, also change
  - line 33 Start Path from "RisingWorldServer.exe" to "rw_server.exe"
  - Your main Java needs to be jre1.8 another java will not work. 

## PLEASE ‚≠êSTAR‚≠ê THE REPO IF YOU LIKE IT! THANKS!

- If You don't know How: Google: YourRouterBrand + Portforwarding ( https://portforward.com/ can also help)
- 4255 TCP+UDP 	- Default Game Port

### Not having an full IPv4 adress ( named CCNAT or DSL Light )
No game or gameserver supports ipv6 only connections. 
- You need to either buy one (most VPN services provide that option. A pal uses ovpn.net for his server, I know of nordvpn also providing that. Should both cost around 7‚Ç¨ cheaper half of it, if your already having an VPN)
- Or you pay a bit more for your internet and take a contract with full ipv4. (depending on your country)
- There are also tunneling methods, which require acces to a server with a full ipv4. Some small VPS can be obtained, not powerfull enough for the servers themself, but only for forwarding. I think there are some for under 5‚Ç¨), the connection is then done via wireguard. but its a bit configuration heavy to setup) 

Or you connect your friends via VPN to your net and play via local lan then.
Many windowsgsm plugin creators recommend zerotier (should be a free VPN designated for gaming) , see chapter below (or tailscale, but no howto there)

## How can you play with your friends without port forwarding?
- Use [zerotier](https://www.zerotier.com/) folow the basic guide and create network
- Download the client app and join to your network
- Create static IP address for your host machine
- Edit WGSM IP Address to your recently created static IP address
- Give your network ID to your friends
- After they've joined to your network
- They can connect using the IP you've created eg: 10.123.17.1:7777
- Enjoy
